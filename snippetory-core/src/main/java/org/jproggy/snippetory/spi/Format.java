/**
 * The format allows one to encapsulate and reuse portions of view logic in a simple and generic
 * manner.
 * <h2>Format definition in template file</h2>
 * Formats are activated by a single attribute, that's evaluated by a {@link FormatFactory},
 * that parses this definition, found within the template file, in order to create an appropriate
 * {@code Format}. However, before creating the format itself there is another step to take:
 * The FormatFactory returns a {@link FormatConfiguration} which takes additional parameters, called
 * sub-attributes. Sub attributes have the form {@code <main-attribute>.<sub-attribute>} and directly
 * follow the main attribute. For instance:
 * <p>
 * {@code stretch="20" stretch.align="left"}
 * </p>
 * Sub-attributes are implemented as bean properties of the {@link FormatConfiguration} implementation:
  * <pre>
 *  enum Alignment {left, right};
 *  public void setAlign(Alignment value) {..
 * </pre>
 * This mechanism provides support for numbers, boolean, enums, and strings.
 * Alternatively, especially when the attributes are not known at build time, this can be done
 * by implementing {@link DynamicAttributes} instead. However, the separation of Format
 * and FormatConfiguration is for advanced state handling and validation of the configuration. For
 * most Formats extending {@link SimpleFormat} makes things much simpler by combining
 * both.
 * <h2>Binding data to formats at runtime</h2>
 * In order to bind data to a format at runtime you have to implement {@link VoidFormat} and
 * of course you've to take care for handling the state appropriately. Returning a new instance per
 * call of {@link FormatConfiguration#getFormat} will do the job.
