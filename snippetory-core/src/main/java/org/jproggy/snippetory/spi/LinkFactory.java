/**
 * A LinkFactory is registered to create a new linking attribute.
 * <p>
 * Link definition in templates is done  by attributes. Every format has exactly one main
 * attribute and an arbitrary number of sub-attributes. The name of sub-attributes starts
 * with the name of the main attribute followed by a dot and the name of the sub-attribute.
 * That way every link has it's own name space.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * To be able to use a link in Snippetory one has to register LinkFactory able to create
 * it. The creation process of a {@link Link} consists of three steps. First an instance of
 * {@code FormatFactory} is registered at {@link Format#register(String, FormatFactory)}. The FormatFactory
 * creates a {@link FormatConfiguration}. The  FormatConfiguration in turn will get the
 * sub-attributes provided via setter-methods. The FormatConfiguration is stored, and
 * every time a new Location is copied the configuration will be asked for a format instance.
 * </p>
